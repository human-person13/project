        <p>
            This study investigates how educational institutions in Antipolo City are integrating alternate teaching resources, such as projector alternatives. This study explores the viability and efficacy of using projector alternatives to improve teaching and learning environments in response to the growing need for creative teaching approaches. This research intends to offer workable alternatives for the local context by looking at Antipolo City's present technological landscape, educational methods, and the difficulties teachers have when using traditional projectors. It also assesses how projector substitutes affect learning outcomes overall, student engagement, and instructional effectiveness. The study's conclusions are meant to give policymakers, educational technology developers, and stakeholders in education useful information and suggestions to encourage the integration of projector replacement devices in educational environments in Antipolo City.
