                <h3>About the album</h3><br>
                <p class="p1">CHROMAKOPIA marks Tyler, The Creator’s eighth studio album, breaking his long-lived two-year project release window on odd-numbered years. The album was first revealed with the teaser of the intro track, “ST. CHROMA,” on October 16, 2024.

                    During the making of the album, Tyler remained silent—going as far as inferring that he would not be releasing any new music in 2024. His endeavors between the release of CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST and CHROMAKOPIA’s release included: forging his own Louis Vuitton collection, joining forces with Converse, and even releasing CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST: The Estate Sale in 2023.
                    
                    The artwork and release date for CHROMAKOPIA was revealed on October 17, just a day after the “ST. CHROMA” teaser, via X and Instagram where Tyler announced that all songs will be written, produced, and arranged by him. Along with the reveal, the Golf Wang website was updated with merchandise of CHROMAKOPIA, featuring physical bundles and an early CD pressing of the album.
                    
                    On October 21, the album’s official lead single, “Noid,” released. With its Instagram post reveal, Tyler noted it as the third album track.</p>
