        <article ><h4>Background</h4><img src="img/Tyler Guy.jpg" alt="Tyler the creator"><p>Tyler, the Creator, born Tyler Gregory Okonma on March 6, 1991, in Ladera Heights, California, grew up in a dynamic environment that deeply influenced his artistry. Raised primarily by his single mother, he often faced instability due to frequent moves during his childhood. This lack of a consistent home life fueled his creativity and desire to express himself through music.
            
            From a young age, Tyler showed an interest in art and music. He started producing beats and experimenting with sounds as a teenager, drawing inspiration from various genres, including hip-hop, punk, and jazz. In 2007, he co-founded the hip-hop collective Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All (OFWGKTA), which became a cultural phenomenon. The group’s raw, unapologetic approach to music and its DIY ethic resonated with a generation, and they quickly gained a devoted following.
            
            Tyler's debut album, Goblin (2011), marked his entry into the mainstream music scene, showcasing his provocative lyrics and distinctive production style. As he continued to release music, his work evolved significantly, moving from shock value to more introspective themes. His 2017 album, Flower Boy, was particularly notable for its exploration of identity, loneliness, and self-acceptance, earning him critical acclaim and a Grammy nomination.
            
            In addition to his music career, Tyler has made significant strides in fashion with his brand, Golf Wang, and has ventured into television and film, including the sketch comedy series Loiter Squad. Known for his boundary-pushing creativity, Tyler continues to be a major influence in both the music industry and popular culture, constantly redefining his artistic vision.

                <p>Goblin is Tyler, The Creator’s major label debut and second album overall, released in May 10, 2011. The album features the rapper’s most controversial lines that involve homophobia and misogyny, such as in the song “Tron Cat,” in which Tyler raps:

                    Victim, victim, honey, you’re my fifth one
                    Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system
                    Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome
                    
                    As well as the album featuring Tyler’s breakout single, “Yonkers.”
                    
                    The California native continues the story between him and his therapist, Dr. TC, as he appeared on his first solo project, Bastard. As the sessions progress, Tyler loses touch of reality and kills all of his friends, just to realize that all of the characters, including Dr. TC are all just a part of his imagination.
                    
                    This is the second project to have the last track complete the title for the project, as it can also be seen in Bastard, as the final track is titled</p></div></li></ul><div class="divider"></div>
