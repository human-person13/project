                <h3>About the album</h3><br>
                <p class="p1">
                    IGOR (pronounced EEE-GORE), released on May 17, 2019, is Tyler, the Creator’s sixth studio album. The announcement of the album came after some speculations the week before, followed by the release of four snippets on Tyler, The Creator’s social media platforms.
                    The album contains features from artists such as Kanye West, Charlie Wilson, CeeLo Green, Solange, Lil Uzi Vert, and Playboi Carti and includes numerous vocal samples from comedian Jerrod Carmichael, although none are credited as features.
                    
                    Thematically, IGOR’s arc describes a love story: falling madly in love but eventually breaking it off and accepting that the relationship is over while attempting to remain friends.
                    
                    The album received a GRAMMY Award for “Best Rap Album” at the 62nd Annual GRAMMY Awards. This choice stirred up some controversy, as some believed that the album should not be considered a rap album and the nomination was racially motivated. Tyler himself stated his frustrations during a Radio Room Interview after the GRAMMYs:
                    
                    I’m very grateful that what I made could just be acknowledged in a world like this. But also, it sucks that whenever we, and I mean guys that look like me, do anything that’s genre-bending, they always put it in a ‘rap’ or ‘urban’ category. […] Why can’t we just be in pop?
                    
                    The album was voted the Genius community’s Best Album of 2019, surpassing Ariana Grande’s thank u, next and Billie Eilish’s WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?.</p>
